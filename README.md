   cd CARJAN
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Run the following commands to set up the required dependencies:

     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - For Node.js:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

If you are unfamiliar with setting up AJAN, follow the official tutorial for general setup steps:

- [AJAN Editor Wiki](https://github.com/aantakli/AJAN-editor#readme)
- [AJAN Service Wiki](https://github.com/aantakli/AJAN-service#readme)

It is mandatory that you set up the Triplestore accordingly.

### **3. Starting the Services**

The CARJAN Scenario Editor relies on several services, including the AJAN Service and the CARJAN-specific components.

#### **Step 1: Start the AJAN Service**

1. Navigate to the AJAN service folder.
2. Start the services using the following command:

   ```bash
   ./startAll.sh
   ```

   _(For Windows, use `startAll.bat`)_

   This will:

   - Open two terminals.
   - Launch the Triple Store and the AJAN Execution Service.

#### **Step 2: Start the AJAN Editor**

1. Navigate to the AJAN Editor directory.
2. Start the required components:

   - **Editor**:
     ```bash
     ./startEditor.sh
     ```
   - **CARJAN Service**:
     ```bash
     ./startCarjanService.sh
     ```
   - **Report Service**:
     ```bash
     ./startReportService.sh
     ```

   _(For Windows, use `.bat` equivalents instead of `.sh`.)_

### **4. Accessing the Editor**

Once the services are running:

1. **Access the main editor** at:
   - [http://localhost:4200/home](http://localhost:4200/home)
   - Make sure you have [defined a triple store](https://github.com/aantakli/AJAN-editor?tab=readme-ov-file#interaction-with-ajan-service).
2. **Access CARJAN directly** at:
   - [http://localhost:4200/editor/services/carjan](http://localhost:4200/editor/services/carjan)
